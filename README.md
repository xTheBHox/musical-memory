# Musical Memory

Author: Benjamin Huang

Design: This is an audio-only game. You could play it even if you were visually impaired, as long as you were familiar with keyboard layout.

Screen Shot:

Sorry, there are no graphics.

How To Play:

Make sure you turn audio on.

In this game, you match sounds. Each letter on the keyboard corresponds to a sound. Sounds vary in pitch and tone.
To match two sounds, hold the first key down and press the second key. Press the spacebar to hear remaining keys.
Before the game starts, you have 15 seconds to memorize the sounds, and pressing keys does not count towards your try count.

Sounds are generated using code synthesis.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
